INDUSTRIAL VISIT
The students of II, III & IV year are sent for Industrial Visits to have an exposure to the state of art facilities pertaining to their ongoing curriculum for the betterment of their understanding at various organizations like ISRO, BHAVINI, SUBSTATION, POWER PLANT, SWITCH GEAR MANUFACTURING etc.

 
 
ECUBE  -  A week of E3 – Enrichment, Enhancement, Empowerment. These, in a nutshell, are the focus areas of our week-long value-addition exercises for students to be conducted in the month of July, for the II, III and IV year  students of our college. Technical Seminars in topics that are an extrapolation of the curriculum will be presented by students. Students will also present their Mini-Projects and will cover all aspects of engineering, right from planning and analysis. This is an exercise aimed at enriching the knowledge and skills of the students.
A student at the crossroads of life must be guided and presented with options in order to make informed decisions about their careers. Career guidance and counseling activities have been planned to enhance the decision-making ability of the students at one of the most crucial junctures of their lives. Participating in group discussions and training in facing interviews are two essential skills that must be acquired by all students. Group Discussions and Mock Interviews have been organized to empower the student.

 

 
CONFERENCE:

The Department of EEE was the first to organize the International conference of Meenakshi Sundararajan Engineering College, ICOBIAHC ’09, a three day (6th August to 8th August) international event. We received nearly hundred and twenty papers of which forty papers were short-listed after proper review by the technical panel and were scheduled under six sessions. Our panel members and delegates were from India and from foreign countries like USA, UK, Turkey, Australia, Korea and Malaysia. The best presented papers of the conference were published in leading International Journals
Multi-disciplinary international conference on solar-energy 2012
National Conference on Technological Innovations in Electrical Engineering [NCTIEE] on 18.03.2017
National Conference on “Recent Trends in Electrical Engineering: on 9.03.18

 
 
TECHNICAL SEMINAR:
                  The one day technical seminar titled VIDYUTH,  adaylong event which attempts to provide all round development to the students. Various speakers from industries  such as TNEB, VI Microsystems, Robert Bosch, ETS, Alstom, BHAVINI  etc..and from institutions such as Anna University, SRM university  are invited to give lectures.
 
 

SYMPOSIUM
Every year, the event most anticipated for by the students, the technical Symposium EPSILON is conducted in an extravagant manner. It is a phenomenal technical endeavor and the ultimate quencher for limitless thirst for knowledge .The event sees an overwhelming number of participants from various colleges around the city. The symposium is a grand success with a turnover of 500+  students from other colleges and an eye-opener for the students in the fields of technical developments
