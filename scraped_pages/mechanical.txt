INFRASTRUCTURE
The vision of our institution is to provide facilities for students to learn the skills needed to become an industry ready mechanical engineer. Towards realization of this vision, we have established manufacturing laboratories, with an array of conventional machines like lathe, planner, shaper, slotter, milling machine etc. as well as modern method machines like CNC lathes, CNC machining center, Electric Discharge machines, Wire Cut EDM and Injection moulding machines which are having a capacity to undertake the industrial work load from the leading industries like Lucas TVS etc., We also provide support services for manufacturing press tools, jigs, fixtures etc. A state of the art metrology laboratory is being put in place for training our students in modern methods of design, manufacture, Inspection and testing.
We have established a computer laboratory in the Mechanical Engineering department with a bank of 72 High configuration computers equipped with licensed software’s such as CRE-O, Auto Cad, MSC Nastran and ADAMs Multi-body dynamics simulation software. This facility enables our students to learn to design components, to carry out 3D modeling, and to undertake projects in the areas of product design, development, and manufacturing. We have left no stone unturned with the intention of ensuring our students who graduate are highly competent Mechanical Engineers contributing in Nation Building Activities.

Students are enrolled to become membership and encourage to participate in all engineering event organized by SAE India. The student chapter organizes various events such as guest lectures, industrial visits, and competitions etc. for the SAE student members. The student members actively participate in all the events organized by SAE India like BAJA, Bi-Cycle Design Challenge and etc.
 
The SAE India magazines key in on hot topics about ground vehicle and aircraft developments, providing members with a valuable resource to help keep pace with rapidly changing technology in the mobility industry. One hard copy of each is also sent to one of the faculty Advisers in kept in department library for student’s reference. Students are taken to the leading automotive vehicle and component manufactories companies through their collegiate clubs based on request to these companies (however, it is no mandatory for these companies to accept the request all the time) these visits give first-hand information about the industrial environment and also attend technical seminars delivered by industry professionals. Student member participate in various technical event and attend technical seminar conducted by SAE INDIA.

All faculties are trained to use Google Classroom. Also Students submit their assignment through Classroom.
All faculties use teaching aids and model demonstration during Classroom Lecture. Especially for the course Engineering Graphics, the first year students are thought using teaching aids like models of solids for understanding their projection and video lecture of solved problems are also made by department faculty in you tube Channel.
Use of modern teaching aids like LCD projectors are usually employed in classrooms and other student learning environments.
Faculties share Academic study material using digital library
Department conducts Seminar, workshops, expert talks and Industrial visits on every semester
Department has introduced Mini projects every semester in the curriculum
Students are encouraged to participate National and Internal conferences in coordination with Faculty members
Faculty members use digital library and other open source platforms such as NPTEL video lectures to make the subject easy to understand
Faculty members are encouraged to participate in short term courses, staff development programs and workshops on advanced topics to keep pace with the advanced level of knowledge and skills. Over the past years, Faculty members have been participating/ presenting papers in National / International conferences and publish their articles to enrich their knowledge
Faculty utilize department library as well as College main library for reference
Library has state of art digital library, E Learning Centre, Video Conference Room, Students Discussion rooms, Faculty discussion room, and Books & Reference Section, Circulation Counter, Journals/Magazines and Newspaper Section are made available in the library building

EVENTS
The department maintains a very vibrant academic atmosphere through varies academic initiatives.
E-Cube (Enrichment, Enhancement and Empowerment) Programme
Various activities are organized through the E-cube event during every academic year for the students. Every individual student participates in paper presentation on a technical topic of their interest. The third and final year student had to present a mini-project plan. Eminent people are invited from the core industries to judge the student competence and to expose them to real life challenges. The projects are analyzed to industrial standards and are given valuable assistance for implementation. The students are also guided for resume writing and a mock interview is conducted by officials invited from core companies. The event is well appreciated by our alumni as it enabled the students to enrich, enhance and empower themselves to be ready for the future industry.
AKSHOBYA – ONE DAY TECHANICAL SEMINAR
The mechanical engineering one day technical seminar provides an opportunity to all students to increase the depth of his scientific knowledge. It also offers an ideal platform to initiate discussion on recent trend and development in the industry and also topic on interdisciplinary work cutting across boundaries. There is a regular stream of visitors to the department from varies institution, core industries and research organizations, resulting in industrial collaboration and interactive seminar for the benefit of students.
Engineer’s Day
The management, staff and students celebrate Engineer’s Day every year as a tribute to the greatest Indian Engineer Bharat Ratna Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya. “Role of Engineer’s in the developing India is the theme of Engineer’s Day. After the floral tribute, the department Newsletter “SPARKS” and project summary is release by the distinguished chief guest. Eminent research scholars are invited to present their research work and discuss about recent developments in industries.

Solar Energy Project:

Establishing a 3X5kWp Solar PV Plant, Partly funded by MNRE, Government of India, through TANGEDCO, TN. MSEC has set up a 15 kWp solar PV system. It has three types of solar panels, namely, mono-crystalline (5kWp), Polycrystalline (5kWp) and thin film (5kWp). We have initiated a few projects using these. It is our ambition to generate an exhaustive data base of solar panels at varying operational conditions and supplying various types of loads at one site. The data would lead to the development of a useful process model of solar energy utilization. These engineering data would be invaluable input to design of large scale solar energy systems. System performance and reliability in specific application will be monitored.
