ALUMINI TESTIMONIALS:
MSEC has everything that a student possibly wants. It has good credibility in terms of placements. Subject expertise faculties are what make engineering in MSEC a worthy one. Well established labs are provided for practical understanding of course matter especially for civil. MSEC not only focuses on creating bookworms, instead it focuses on creating a holistic engineer. Fun and Festivals are also involved, because this is the age to enjoy!. Location is also comfortable for students since it has multiple transportation availability nearby. Overall, a good college which would be a stepping stone for your career.

I am sandra marianne anand and it gives me great pleasure to talk about my home for four years - meenakshi sundararajan engineering college. As an alumnus of the civil engineering department , the environment not only helped me achieve great heights academically but also fostered a nurturing ambience with  professors who were superlative guides. Discipline was enforced through daily activities the value of which was known once I graduated. Friendship and camaraderie thrived in our classrooms and studying was fun. My leadership skills  came to the fore with Wafes 2014 symposium where I Coordinated the whole event and also learnt to work as a part of a team , which helps me even today. Being a basketball player it helped me mingle with both junior and senior students at college and this also taught me that life is just not about studying, as the college gave me opportunities to excel in other extra curricular activities too. As out college is located in the centre , my residence was the favourite haunt of my friends to catch up with college work.

   All the nurturing my professors did back at MSEC, is what I am today, learning to stand independently and thriving to achieve my future goals. My college gave me beautiful memories and am proud to have been part of this great institution and my alma mater will always remain close to my heart.

 MSEC is a brand that would add value to your profile. The assignments and number of class tests will be tough, yet will help you learn. The e-cube, symposiums, one day seminars and workshops will help you develop your soft skills. Overall, these exposures will aid your development. Grab the opportunities and make use of the platform.

MSEC has helped to develop several world-class engineers. The molding of each generation of engineers is seen personally by beloved staff of MSEC. The students of MSEC have streamlined into government organizations, PSU's and several reputed design MNC's due to their persistent thirst of knowledge and passion. They are trained in a manner to readily handle the corporate and fast growing technical world.

I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor of Engineering in Civil Engineering from MSEC. I had friends at other local colleges bragging about how easy college was. I was the opposite. I complained about how hard college was. But MSEC pushed me to the edge, towards my potential, and then asked me to turn around, go back, and do it again. Four Years, later I thank “MSEC” & especially “The Department of Civil Engineering for preparing me with the ironclad determination that they knew would be needed for my successful, fun, and amazing journey in my very progressive career in Construction. The professors really focused on subjects that prepared us to face the challenging Industry which is construction, which I'm still grateful to have. MSEC has helped me advance in my career, which lead me to pursue Master’s degree in Construction Management in one of the Top University for construction degrees in USA.I currently work in one of the top Multinational Construction Company In USA. I would recommend MSEC to anyone looking to have a successful career and advance their careers in Construction.

 MSEC has nutured me and made me what I am today. It made me more disciplined and helped me to grow not only professionally but holistically as a good human being. MSEC has excellent teaching faculty with well equipped labs, ventilated classrooms, library etc. The right atmosphere is created to the students by the teachers in the classroom to mould the personality of each and every student. MSEC not only impart knowledge but also instills life skills in us to make us socially responsible citizens. In this competitive and expensive era, the objective of MSEC is imparting quality education at affordable cost which is really praise worthy. I am really fortunate to study in this prestigious institution which provides a perfect platform to students to prove themselves. I thank all my teachers and MSEC who has helped me to reach this position.

MSEC provided a high standard of education with which we are able to face the challenges in this era of technology and innovations. The classroom environment they created made us learn peacefully and effectively. The dedicated building for Civil department highly equipped with source of practical knowledge, the laboratories made us apply and understand the content in syllabi. We praise, thank and appreciate the faculty team who were dedicated more than themselves in teaching. Their approach in teaching out of books enabled us to outstand in all objectives in the field. Through events - E-cube and Symposium they made us understand the perspectives of different people, innovations and proved our inner potential wisely.Along with the knowledge, they never relinquished to impart moral values in our hearts. Which still blooms in our spirit and it will in the future. The life what we live now proves the very first motivation given by the halls of ivy that the four year education will take care of forty years of life. We wish our alma mater to continue creating more young buds intelligent and a good citizen.

Research:
 It’s about people and their lives, everywhere. We challenge the status quo with our research and educational programs, advance the frontiers of knowledge, expand the limit of the possible, and innovate. Using science and engineering, we solve some of our time’s toughest challenges through the creation of systems with large-scale tangible impact at the nexus of environment, infrastructure and people.
We develop and use pioneering approaches that range from basic scientific principles to complex engineering design, at scales from the nano to the global.
The positioning of civil department is defined by a set of strategic challenge areas (addressing major societal challenges) and academic fields of interest. The academic fields of interest reflect the intellectual disciplines of our faculty, their academic background, and teaching interests (and is reflected in their contributions to our academic programs for undergraduate and graduate studies ;)The academic fields of interests define how Civil faculty and students contribute to the strategic challenge areas. The strategic challenge areas reflect a set of five broad areas that are research priorities for :

Ecological Systems
Resources and Sustainability
Structures and Design
Urban Systems
Construction Engineering & Management

The     department       is    equipped      with     various      equipment’s      to undertake research and consultancy activities.
The testing activities includes 

Cube compressive testing
